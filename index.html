        Hello! My name is Angela Wang, I’m currently a Sophomore at Staten
        Island Technical Highschool. I’m 14 years old, turning 15 on October 17,
        2007. My favorite colors are purple and pink. I enjoy drawing, as well
        as coding, and took realistic still-life art classes in middle school.
      </p>
      <p class="em-size">
        I’m currently thinking about joining the stage crew for SING, as well as
        getting involved with more things in school such as more clubs and
        volunteering for things like the freshman social. My schedule is listed
        below, along with my thoughts on my experience so far, feel free to talk
        to me if you have any of the same classes as me!
      </p>
