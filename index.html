        Hello! My name is Angela Wang, I’m currently a Sophomore at Staten
        Island Technical Highschool. I’m 14 years old, turning 15 on October 17,
        2007. My favorite colors are purple and pink. I enjoy drawing, as well
        as coding, and took realistic still-life art classes in middle school.
      </p>
      <p class="em-size">
        I’m currently thinking about joining the stage crew for SING, as well as
        getting involved with more things in school such as more clubs and
        volunteering for things like the freshman social. My schedule is listed
        below, along with my thoughts on my experience so far, feel free to talk
        to me if you have any of the same classes as me!

        Mr, Whalen has a sense of humor that you rarely see in teachers, with
        basically no homework at all, unless you're behind on your projects in
        school. That is to say, I’ve been lagging a bit behind with my projects
        because I’m not used to using a computer with all its controls and
        whatnot. But in the end, I do enjoy learning about JavaScript/coding for
        designing websites and such. (N)
